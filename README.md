* **Python:** The primary programming language used throughout the project for its readability and robust web development capabilities.
* **HTML:**  Used to define the structure and content of the web pages.
* **CSS:**  Used for styling the visual presentation of the website.
* **JavaScript:**  Used for adding interactivity and dynamic elements to the web pages. 

**Additional Libraries & Frameworks:**

* **Django Allauth:** Simplifies user authentication and registration processes.

## Bugs Found and Fixed

### Bug Fixes

#### 1. Static Files Not Updating in Production
- **Issue**: Changes to `style.css` were not reflecting in the production environment.
- **Root Cause**: Misconfiguration in the handling of static files between development (`DEBUG = True`) and production (`DEBUG = False`).
- **Solution**: Implemented WhiteNoise to serve static files efficiently in production. Configured `STATICFILES_STORAGE` to use `whitenoise.storage.CompressedManifestStaticFilesStorage` and ensured correct settings in `STATIC_ROOT` and `STATICFILES_DIRS`.
- **Outcome**: Static files now update correctly in both development and production environments.

#### 2. Conflicting Static Files Storage Settings
- **Issue**: The project had conflicting settings for `STATICFILES_STORAGE` which caused confusion in static file handling.
- **Root Cause**: `STATICFILES_STORAGE` was set to both `cloudinary_storage.storage.StaticHashedCloudinaryStorage` and `whitenoise.storage.CompressedManifestStaticFilesStorage` in the settings.
- **Solution**: After evaluating both options, we decided to use WhiteNoise for its simplicity and efficiency in serving static files directly from the server. Removed the Cloudinary storage setting.
- **Outcome**: Simplified the static file handling and removed the dependency on external services for serving static files.

### 3. duplicated Files in Git Repository:
- **The duplicate files were removed from the Git repository using the command:**
    ```bash
    git rm --cached img
    ```

### Ongoing Issues

- **Current Bugs**: No critical bugs are currently impacting production. Minor UI adjustments are in progress.
- **Monitoring**: Continuously monitoring the application performance and user feedback to identify and fix any emerging issues promptly.

### Conclusion

The above fixes have significantly improved the stability and performance of our application. I committed to maintaining a high standard of quality and responsiveness in addressing any future issues that may arise.
